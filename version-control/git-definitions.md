# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?  version control is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information.  It is useful as an example in catching bugs because you can see when a change was made in code and see when the code stopped working.  
* What is a branch and why would you use one?  Branches are different versions of documents, computer programs, and other collections of information.  Branches are useful if you want to make edits to a program and merge them together so you can make changes without changing the original until you merge the branches.  
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?  A commit is a save point in Git.  A good commit message is specific to the changes made.  
* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is when your current branch and the branch you want to merge went in different directions.  You have commits in your current branch that are not in the master branch, and vice versa.
